		<h2>Listening to music 🎼</h2>
		<p>
			Music in my opinion is the best way of expression. Everyone can say what they feel through a song. it's a way oh sharing a message who has an importance that can have an impact on people's lives on a small or large scale.

		<h2>Going out with my friends 👯‍♀️</h2>
		<p>
		It's the best way to have a smile and be sure that you will have a good time. Listening to music, going to the cinema or to restaurants allows us to take our mind off things and decompress.

		<h2>Traveling all around the world 🌎</h2>
		<p>
			Traveling is the best way to discover new cultures and lifestyles as well as to grow and mature. I like the fact that I have the chance to discover new landscapes, different food, languages I don't know. Each country is unique and this is what makes the diversity and uniqueness of each of our trips.
